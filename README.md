# Journey App

This app is very much still under development and I am very much learning as I go.

The Journey app is a replacement for a Google sheet I use to track my fuel consumption and costs as I drive from point A to point B in my life. Using various formulas and my expert excel knowledge I was able to better visualise how much it cost to drive my car. Unfortunately though, filling out a Google sheet is quite annoying, so I decided to make it into an app.  
I use a MongoDb Atlas NoSql Database to store each journey entry and then go from there‚Ä¶
