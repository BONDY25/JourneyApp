This app is very much still under development and I am very much learning as I go.

The Journey app is a replacement for a Google sheet I use to track my fuel consumption and costs as I drive from point A to point B in my life. Using various formulas and my expert excel knowledge I was able to better visualise how much it cost to drive my car. Unfortunately though, filling out a Google sheet is quite annoying, so I decided to make it into an app.  
I use a MongoDb Atlas NoSql Database to store each journey entry and then go from thereâ€¦

As of right now, both the MongoDB atlas and Render web hosting services I used are the free versions which is why it can be a little slow.

**Currently in phase 2 After getting basic functionallity complete so users can view, add and edit journeys. Now for QoL imporvements and some more interesting features!**

## Current "To Do"

* Add Budget Tracking Feature
* Expand insights into Distance, Time and consuption sub headings and add more interesting facts:
    * percentage of time driving since first journey
    * Condition/percentage of times it was wet
* Add user setting for Speed unit (MPH, KM/H)
* Add user setting for distance unit (Miles, KM)
* Add user themes Light/dark/etc...
* Add mileage/time targets/limits
* Add ability to create graphical representations of stats, e.g. line graph, bar charts.
* Add Ability to export data to CSV
